# Bit Manipulation

Bit Manipulation is the process of applying logic operations on a sequence of bits. Bit manipulation is especially 
useful for manipulating sequences of bits shorter than a word. We will begin by defining bits and looking at how we can represent
numbers using bits.

| &     | AND | DESC | 
| \|      | OR      |   DESC|

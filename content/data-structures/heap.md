# Heaps

This section will discuss (binary) min, and max heaps. A (max) `Heap` is a binary tree will the following two properties: 
```
1. Structural Property - Heaps are completely filled (except possibly the last level, which is left justified). 
2. Heap Order Preoperty - For any node i, the key of the parent node is >= the key of i.  
```
A min heap is the same except with the opposite heap order property.
